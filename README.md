BloomWatch by Resonans Co

An application for global monitoring of Earth's flowering phenology




Project Summary

BloomWatch by Resonans Co is an interactive app that visualizes and analyzes global blooming patterns using NASA Earth observation data. It bridges science, technology, and art to help users feel the living rhythm of our planet.

Vegetation on Earth constantly changes ‚Äî from season to season, from year to year ‚Äî revealing vital information about plant species, crops, seasonal cycles, pollen sources, and phenological shifts (the relationship between climate and plant life).

Our project transforms NASA‚Äôs satellite data into a dynamic visual tool that detects and displays flowering events across the globe, similar to how pollinators observe the world. It can be used for monitoring, forecasting, education, and research in environmental science.




Project Demonstration

üåç Interactive prototype and visual animations (to be presented at NASA Space Apps 2025).
üì∫ Video demonstration ‚Äì coming soon!




Project

The BloomWatch platform processes NASA Earth data, satellite imagery, and vegetation indices to visualize areas of plant blooming. Users can explore the timeline of seasonal changes and observe how climate affects flowering cycles in different regions.

The project also integrates artistic and multimedia components to make data emotionally engaging and easy to understand, connecting science with creativity and storytelling.




Project Details

Goal: To create an accessible and visually rich tool that helps researchers, educators, and enthusiasts monitor and understand global blooming events.

Methods: Data visualization, animation, and satellite imagery analysis.

Technology: Python, Google Earth Engine, Unity/Unreal (for visualization), NASA Earth observation datasets.

Applications: Environmental education, climate studies, agriculture monitoring, and creative communication of science.





Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI)

BloomWatch may use machine learning algorithms to identify and predict flowering regions based on vegetation indices and climate trends. AI helps enhance pattern recognition and improve seasonal forecasting accuracy.

Challenge

Your challenge is to harness NASA Earth observation data to create a dynamic and engaging visual system that reveals blooming events worldwide ‚Äî just like pollinators sense changes in their environment. The result should foster awareness, prediction, and appreciation of the delicate link between climate and vegetation.
